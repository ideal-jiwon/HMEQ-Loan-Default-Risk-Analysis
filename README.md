# HMEQ Loan Default & Loss Amount Prediction (Tree + Regression)

This project uses decision trees, ensemble methods, and regression to analyze customer loan default probability and potential financial loss. Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA & t-SNE) are also applied to observe changes in model performance.

---

## Key Results Summary

To evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction on model performance, PCA and t-SNE were applied before retraining tree-based and regression models.

| Model Type | AUC (Original Data) | AUC (PCA/t-SNE Data) |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| GINI       | 0.8433              | 0.8289               |
| ENTROPY    | 0.8294              | 0.8383               |
| REGRESSION | 0.9105              | 0.9124               |

### Key Observations

- ðŸ”» **GINI**: Performance slightly decreased, suggesting PCA/t-SNE may have obscured decision boundaries critical to this criterion.  
- ðŸ”º **ENTROPY**: Performance improved, possibly due to enhanced separability in high-entropy regions.  
- âž– **REGRESSION**: Remained stable, indicating that **linear patterns were preserved** even after dimensionality reduction.

### Conclusion

While PCA/t-SNE can remove noise from irrelevant variables, its effect varies by model type:  
- Tree-based models (GINI, ENTROPY) showed **different sensitivities** to the transformed input space.  
- Regression performance was **robust**, reinforcing that principal variance directions remained aligned with the original data.  
- Overall, **dimensionality reduction helped interpretability** but **did not significantly improve predictive power** in this context.

## Modeling Workflow

### 1. Tree & Regression on Original Data

- Trained using GINI, ENTROPY, and Regression split criteria.
- Evaluated using AUC on ROC Curve.

ROC Curve:
![ROC AUC - Original](./Graphs/ROC/ROC-AUC.png)

**Conclusion**:
- Regression split yielded the **highest AUC (0.91)**.
- Tree-based splits also performed well.

### 2. Tree & Regression on PCA/t-SNE Transformed Data

- Applied PCA and t-SNE to reduce dimensionality.
- Re-trained the same models on the transformed dataset.

ðŸ“ˆ ROC Curve:
![ROC AUC - PCA:tSNE](./Graphs/ROC/Tree and Regression Analysis on the PCA:tSNE Dat.png)

**Key Observations**:
- GINI AUC **decreased** slightly â†’ PCA/tSNE obscured some tree-based separability.
- ENTROPY AUC **increased** â†’ Transformation helped clarify some entropy-based splits.
- REGRESSION AUC remained stable â†’ linear structure preserved.
